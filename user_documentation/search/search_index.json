The system is designed to help financial institutions, including banks and microfinance institutions, calculate and report impairment losses on financial assets. The tool specifically aligns with the Bank of Ghana\u2019s regulatory requirements, ensuring compliance with local supervisory expectations while maintaining international accounting standards. The application is built as a data-driven, predictive risk assessment tool, leveraging statistical models (Logistic Regression, etc ) and Probability of Default (PD) estimations to classify loans into IFRS 9\u2019s three-stage model. The system offers robust data ingestion, processing, and reporting functionalities, with integration capabilities for banking systems.</p>"},{"location":"#key-features-functionalities","title":"Key Features &amp; Functionalities","text":""},{"location":"#1-loan-classification-into-ifrs-9-stages","title":"1.
